This a service that everyone loves to hate. Auditing in IT is important for several reasons, least important being Regulatory compliance, most import being Data Security and Confidence, after all, you can't protect what you don't know.

In Typical organizations there are documentation systems specifically for your business needs that a lot of thought has gone into, and supporting technology stacks, your IT systems are no different, and need consideration as well.  While organizations are often familiar with technologies such as Docuware, WorldDox, or ERP systems like Dynamics and SAP, the IT world has their on solutions as well. There are two Major types of IT documentation, the first one is Secrets, these are your passwords, MFA, API Keys and other sensitive data, the other is Infrastructure, which is very hard to capture in spreadsheets and text documents. Thankfully both of these have secure and robust solutions that cost effective, such as ITGlue, Hudu, and Bitwarden, or their OpenSource counterparts, ITFlow, and VaultWarden. There are some more advanced systems, such as infrastructure as code, but those solutions are out scope for this service.
