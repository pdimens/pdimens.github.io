## Baseline Security

Baseline Security is a collection of all the low hanging fruit in the IT world that are often easy to miss or overlook, but form the bedrock of all IT Security and policies. These include things like creating Position and Access Lists, defining who needs access to what internal services, simple network segregation, creating Systems and network maps, separating privileged accounts.  These tasks may seem trivial, or not related to security, but help you understand what you have to protect, and form the bedrock of more advanced policies and certifications such as SOC2 and ISO 27001. The fundamental part of this process is learn and document what risks your organization has, how severe and impactful they are, and come up with risk management and acceptance profiles.

 - Setting up basic monitoring and and alerting

## Auditing

This a service that everyone loves to hate. Auditing in IT is important for several reasons, least important being Regulatory compliance, most import being Data Security and Confidence. I offer services to assist in both Internally Driven Audits, as well Externally driven Audits for Insurance, Data Protection, CyberSecurity, Budgeting and more.
 - IT Asset Auditing, Do you know where all your laptops are and who has them? How many software licenses and utilization?
 - Security Posture Auditing, Do you have permissive firewall rules? Is everyone a local admin?
 - Cost and Forecasting audits, Do you know your Cost per Employee? Average yearly spend on hardware?
 - Insurance and CyberSecurity, Everyone's Favourite audits these are typically highly involved and difficult to complete without dedicated resources and stakeholder engagement.
 - Configuring and Scheduling regular vulnerability scans


## Consulting and Fractional Services

In the Context of IT Security, Consulting and Fractional Services entail a sustained effort of one more of the above offerings over the course of a longer initiative, typically in 6 month periods, to facilitate a large organization change.
