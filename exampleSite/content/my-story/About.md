## Who I am

I am a Human first and foremost, what this means for me is being able to balance the things that matter to me, my partner, family, friends, and personal growth and health, and the things that matter professionally.  This has led me back to Consulting from Managed Services, and allowed me to take the time to be able to recenter and pursue what makes future me less unhappy. 

I am also:
 - A Caregiver
 - A Cook
 - A Parent of adult children and Pets
 - A Music and B Grade Movie lover
 - An Artist and Wood Carver
 - A Person with Invisible Disabilities
 - A Friend and Ally

## Caregiving and Disability

 I am a Caregiver and Disabled, my partner and I have had to make a variety of changes to our daily.  These modifications to our lives has led to my move back to Consulting and Fractional work, allowing for the flexibility to remove barriers and take the time required to properly give care, and take care of myself.  An important modification required was for me to limit the amount of time spent in settings such as offices settings. We have intense shared food sensitivities, while my partner has an Occupational respiratory disorder triggered often by scented products. With the requirement to increase Isolation to control the particulates that cause this reaction, we moved from the Vancouver Region, and moved out to the Rural Kootenays of BCâ€™s interior. This relocation afforded us more control of the environment, the ability to install a whole house air filtration system, among other controls.  With the constant triggers of the office lifestyle and condensed townhouse living behind us, our mutual health improved, trips to the ER drastically decreased from every 6 weeks, to once a year. My partner and I both have connective tissue disorders, in particular I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. This has given me greater understanding for the ergonomic aspects of workspaces, and how to identify barriers that need to be overcome within them.
 
## Indigenous History

I am a Non-Status member of the Kitsumkalum band of the Tsimshian Nation on my mothers side, and of undetermined ancestry though my paternal grandmother. I grew up separated from those roots, and it has taken me moving from the busy south coast of BC to the Interior of BC to realize and appreciate my ancestry. In the last few years I have had the time to see and connect more, and have started working towards providing services and opportunities to the communities.  While I say I have been disconnected from my roots, and am learning how to reconnect, I have been taught how to create traditional Coast Salish wood carvings by Walter Stoochnoff, and have made my own wood carving tools. I never understood the significance of this education, and with the lens of time have I learned how precious that time and education is.

## Open Source

I have been involved in the Open Source Community for 20 years - in 2004 I started with Gentoo based Sabayon Linux's 3.4 release. I am primarily a user, I provide contributions, and user support to a variety of projects. In recent years my time available to Open Source initiatives has been low, and I am planning become more active. As the tooling and utilities have matured, with instances such as Traefik, and Wazuh entering the professional market and increased containerization of services.
