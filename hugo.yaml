      I'm an marine fish ecologist masquerading as a bioinformatician/geneticist. I studied a coastal shark species for my Masters degree and  *all* the tuna species for my PhD.
      
      Over the years I developed an affinity for the technical and analytical parts of research, along with a [some would argue] pedantic attention to detail in presentation aesthetics. As a result, I design 99% of all of my graphics, templates, gifs from scratch.

      I also adhere to modern approaches to research reproducibility, so I lean heavily on integrating GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, conda environments, and Snakemake workflows for ~100% transparency.

      Besides work, I enjoy cooking, hiking, swimming, rock climbing, scuba diving, relaxing and doing nothing, coding in Julia, carpentry, and the occasional platformer or RPG video game.
